        <h2>New Foldable Mobile Released Comming Soon</h2>
        <div class="zoom">
            <img src="images/gallery_mobile_2.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>Foldable smartphones are coming, and as with curved screens - from the Galaxy Note Edge up to the Galaxy S9 and beyond - Samsung appears to be leading the charge. For a few years now, the company has been sharing concepts of foldable and rollable smartphones, and a flurry of patent applications and rumours suggest the first models are coming very soon.</p>
        <p>Samsung intends to make fully functional smartphones with flexible displays that allow you to fold the phone shut and tuck it in your pocket – and maybe even phones that open up to reveal a full-sized tablet screen within, or touchscreen devices that roll out of a tube.

            Sound crazy? Maybe. Seem expensive? Undoubtedly. Is it exciting? Absolutely. Here's everything we know about the so-called Galaxy X phones so far.</p>
