        <p>The MacBook Pro (sometimes abbreviated as MBP)[1] is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc. It is the high-end model of the MacBook family and is currently available in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. A 17-inch version was available between April 2006 and June 2012.</p>
        <p>The first generation MacBook Pro is externally similar to the PowerBook G4 it replaces, but uses Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch model was introduced first, in January 2006; the 17-inch model followed in April. Both received several updates and Core 2 Duo processors later that year.</p>
        <p>The product's second iteration, known as the "unibody" model, has a casing made from a single piece of aluminum. It debuted in October 2008 in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. In January 2009, the 17-inch model was updated with the same unibody design. Subsequent updates brought upgraded Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and introduced Intel's Thunderbolt technology.</p>

        <p>The back of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL is made from aluminum with a thin "premium coating" of plastic and has a top section made from glass to provide wireless transmissivity. Unlike the original Pixel XL, which was simply an enlarged version of the Pixel design with no other changes, the Pixel 3 XL's external design differs from its smaller sibling, employing a taller 18:9 P-OLED display instead of the Pixel 2's 16:9 AMOLED.</p>
        <p>The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are both powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, coupled with 4 GB LPDDR4X RAM. They both come in storage options of 64 or 128 GB.

            The Pixel 3 has a 5-inch (130 mm) AMOLED display panel with 1920×1080 resolution, coming in at around 441 ppi, while the Pixel 3 XL comes with a 6-inch (150 mm) P-OLED display panel with a 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2880×1440 resolution at 538 ppi.</p>

        <p>The touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or stylus instead of the mouse, trackpad, and keyboard of larger computers. Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and appearance of physical keyboards. Two species of tablet, the "slate" and "booklet", do not have physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on their touchscreen displays.</p>
